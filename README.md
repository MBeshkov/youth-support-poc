# youth-support-poc
A proof of concept for an online service which recommends lockdown compliant activities that invoke positive feelings in young adults. 
Originally created 2020.

The POC should do the following

1. Represent a young adult (in the age group of 16 to 24) and her family (mum, dad and one sibling). Assumption that 
the sibling is in the same age group as the young adult. Beyond the family, the young adult has a social 
network of friends in the same age group and tutors who are adults (age > 24).
2. Add personality traits to the young adult from above.
3. Add a list of activities for a typical day to the young adult assuming normal pre-lockdown life. 
4. Output an anonymized version of the young adult’s data.
5. Output a list of feelings that pre-lockdown activities, in relation to young adult’s personality, invoke in the 
young adult. This step will establish the pre-lockdown feelings in the young adult as a baseline. This step is required only in the POC. When 
you launch your online service, feelings arise in real users of the service. In the POC user responses are computationally
simulated.
6. Apply lockdown which prohibits many of the pre-lockdown activities.
7. Output a list of feelings that lockdown invoked in the young adult. When the investors compare these
feelings with the baseline pre-lockdown feelings from step 5, they should be able to appreciate the need for 
the proposed Youth Support service.
8. Recommend lockdown compliant activities that maximize positive feelings for individual young adults
considering the personality traits of the young adult. This is the main feature of the proposed online 
service and therefore the code from this part should be reusable in the final online service.
9. Output a list of feelings that recommended activities invoked in the young adult. When the investors 
compare these feelings with the pre- and post-lockdown feelings from steps 5 and 7, they should be able to 
see the value of the proposed Youth Support service.
